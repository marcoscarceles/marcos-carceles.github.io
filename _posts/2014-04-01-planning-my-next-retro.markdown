### Sprint Events ###
  + Confrontational discussion about team processes: Breaking down to QA'able tasks and DEV/QA comms (Happened on 21/03/2014)
  + Decided to resteer the project for an early release with different scope (Happened on 26/03/2014)

### Context ###
  + First _Non Full English Retro_, on the afternoon after planning
  + Retaken team's velocity after a couple of bad sprints
  + Last minute environment problems blocked big stories from being delivered
  + First Sprint since QA left
  + New QA about to join, having come to planning

### Retro Topic or Goal ###
  + There is no specific topic
  + Since it is the first retro since the deadline and scope was changed this retrospective may benefit from having an eye on the future.

### Format ###

**Check-in exercise**:
Hapiness radar. As seen on [Agile Tips][hapiness-radar].
Standard Follow Up on previous Retrospective Actions

**Gathering data**:
Since there are important topics on both the past and upcoming events (QA joining, Go Live and Support) an exercise on the format of the Boat Sails, Archor and Rocks or the [Hot Air Balloon][hot-air-balloon], would be useful.

**Generating Insights**:
The team usual process is to group the items into topics (on various formats) and discuss based on dot-voting. Once these topics are chosen it tends to take a while to have the discussion started. To improve this, this time we will use [Plus/Minus Voting][plus-minus-voting]

**Decide What To Do**:
Open discussion started with the items with either most votes overall or more conflict (both Plus and Minus). Try to keep each topic to between 5 and 10 minutes (tops)
Keep notes of the highlights of the conversations and decide on Actions or new Norms

**Closing**:
Thank everyone
Ask everyone to describe the retrospective with an adjective on a post-it and place it on a ROTI (1-5).
